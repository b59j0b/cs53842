Carbon Storage (EAEE E4301) 
Fall   2024 
Homework #1 (Due   Monday, October   7th,   11:59 pm) 
Homework Guidelines: 
Your solutions to homework assignments will be submitted and graded through Gradescope   (see the   Gradescope   tab   on   your   Courseworks   dashboard).
You will have two options for submitting your work in Gradescope, either:  1) upload individual   scanned   images   of         your handwritten pages (e.g., using your phone), one or more per question; or 2) upload a   single PDF that you   create   which contains the whole submission (e.g., merge files on your computer   or phone with   a   software   of   your   choice).
Please use the naming convention Lastname_HWxx.pdf when submitting your homework assignment. You may choose to type up your calculations, in which case show all your steps   and highlight your   solution. Note: During the upload, Gradescope will ask you to mark which page/s each problem is on (see example here). It is important that you follow that step for grading purposes. It is acceptable to discuss problems with your colleagues, and questions are encouraged during office hours, but all work must be done independently. Make sure to clearly show all work on   each problem   and that your   solutions   are      presented in an orderly fashion. It is your responsibility to make your   solutions easy   to   grade.

Problem #1 (The Carbon Cycle) 15 pts In class we reviewed the box model for Earth’s carbon cycle, also   shown below.   The percentages   in   white   text   boxes   represent   the   percentage   of   emitted   anthropogenic   carbon   accumulated   in   the    planet’s major reservoirs.
(a)   Briefly explain why the surface layer of   the ocean   shows an   increase   in   concentration   of   CO2, but the deep ocean   does not.
(b)   Why is there no percentage shown in the   sediments and   crust   reservoir?   How   can   we   change this?
(c)   Of   the 9 Gt of   anthropogenic CO2 emissions, how many Gt must we   offset with   CCUS technologies to offset rising temperatures (e.g. the greenhouse effect)? Don’t overthink - this is a quick calculation.
(d)   Estimate the maximum storage capacity of 10 geologic   formations with   the   following   average properties: lateral area of 10 km x 5 km, height   of   30m, porosity =   0.2, irreducible water saturation (Sw_irr)   = 0.15, and in situ scCO2   density   =   700   kg/m^3. Hint: Back of the envelope calculations are fine. 
Comment   on   the   magnitude   of   this   storage   capacity.

Problem #2 (Geology / porous media) 25 pts 
The   porosity   of a   sandstone   (or   soil   for   that   matter)   is   heavily   dependent   on   the   grain   size   and packing arrangement, among other factors.   See the below figure.
(a)   Mathematically prove that the porosity associated with the simple cubic packing of   equally   sized spheres, shown in the above figure   is   ~0.48. Show your work for credit.
Does   this   value   of   porosity   change   if   the   grain   size   changes   from   a   radius   of   0.1 mm   to   a radius of 1.0 mm? How about permeability?
(b)   Using   the   same   logic,   derive   the   porosity   of   either   an   orthorhombic or rhombohedral   packing of   equal spheres (your choice!), where the grains are shifted and porosity reduced. Show your work for credit.
(c)   Name   2 other factors,   physical and/or chemical,   that can degrade   porosity   in a   rock   formation. Briefly (in a few words)   explain why.
(d)   Would you expect a slight increase or decrease in porosity in an over-pressured formation?   Why?

Problem #3 (Geomechanics) 10 pts 
The below left plot is a generic Mohr–Coulomb plot with failure envelope.

If you want to review geomechanics more, see Rackley Chapter 12. Imagine   that   this Mohr–Coulomb   plot   represents   the   key   rock   type in a candidate storage formation   for   hydrostatic   pressure   conditions.   Your   team   tells   you   that   the   rock   has   the   pore   pressure   properties as shown in the Pressure vs Depth plot on   the   right.
(a)   At a depth of   2000m, describe or draw how the Mohr–Coulomb plot above would change.   (b)   At a depth of   3500m, describe or draw how the Mohr–Coulomb plot above would change.
(c)   What possible scenarios may create the overpressure seen at   the   lower   depths?
Problem #4 (Fluid properties, fluid-rock interactions) 15pts A formation has similar pressures, temperatures and brine properties as the Sleipner-Utsira   formation/CO2   storage pilot. Assume   a   completely hydrophilic   caprock   (e.g.   completely water   -   wetting) of   average pore size r =   100 nm. What is the maximum CO2 column height beyond which   CO2 will enter the caprock through capillary forces?
Now   perform   the   same   calculations   for   an   average   pore   size   of average   pore   size   r   =   1   micron.   Comment on their differences.
Problem #5 (Fluid-rock interactions) 10 pts The below   figure   shows the water   saturation with   depth   (or   height   above    100% water   saturation   line or “Free Water Line”) for   several   geologic   layers.   You   can   assume   that   the   other   fluid   in   the   pore space is carbon dioxide. Assume normal hydrostatic conditions   (no overpressure).
(a)   Which layer is at residual water saturation? What does this mean for the flow of   water and   CO2 in this   layer?
(b)   Rank the layers   from likely highest to   lowest   permeability   based   on   the   character   of   their saturation curves. Which layers might you recommend   as caprocks?
Problem #6 (Geochemical interactions) 25 pts 
The rate r of   calcite dissolution in acid, aqueous solutions   in   moles/m2/s   can   be   estimated   via

where k =  
in which k is the rate constant (a function of   T    pH),   ar is the reactive   surface   area   of   calcite in   the   rock,Q   is   the   activity   product   for   ions   in   the   solution   (in   this   case   Q   =   0.25*[Ca2+]*[H2CO3]   at low pH), KS    is the equilibrium constant (use   10-5    in seawater at pH   3.5), n   and   m   in   the   first expression are   1, kH    is a pre-exponential constant, EH    is the activation energy, R is   the   gas constant, T is the temperature of   interest in Kelvin, T0    is the standard   state   temperature   in   Kelvin   (25°C, 298.15 K), aH    is the activity of   hydrogen ions in   solution (which   we   will   take   to be   equal      to   [H+]) and nH    is an empirical   constant. 
For your reference, for   calcite dissolving in acid water: kH    ≈   10-0.3    moles/m2/s, EH    ≈   14,400   J/mole, and nH    ≈   1.
(a)   What is the rate of   calcite dissolution in water containing 500 ppmw   Ca2+    and   150 ppmw   H2CO3, at 50°C with a pH of 3.5,   in   moles/m2/s?
(b)   When Q = KS, what is the rate of   calcite dissolution? If   Q >   KS,   what   should   happen?
(c)   If   the calcite dissolution rate were 2x10-4    mol/m2/s and the calcite in the rock matrix has a specific surface area of 15/mm and a   density   of   2710 kg/m3, what   is the   rate   of   calcite dissolution in moles/gram/s?
Hint: do not overthink this problem and let the formulas and units be your guide!
